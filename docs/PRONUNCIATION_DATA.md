# Pronunciation Data

The bundled `server/ipa-en-us.txt` is an unmodified copy of the General American
English wordlist from [ipa-dict](https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict).
Only the `en_US` dataset is distributed; other languages and their differing
licenses are not included.

The source project credits [cmudict-ipa](https://github.com/lingz/cmudict-ipa)
and [syllabify](https://github.com/kylebgorman/syllabify) for the US data and
stress markers, based on the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict).
The relevant source notices are reproduced below.

The app looks up this file locally. IPA entries are dictionary references, not
context-sensitive phonetic assessments. Pronunciation examples are generated
by the browser's English speech synthesis; no audio recordings are bundled.
